    <p>I am a student, marshial artist, and musition
        who has become passionate about web page buidling
        programing, ect. For one of my first webpages 
        I will tell my audiece about myself.<br><br>
        One part of me that if feel is teh most interesting
        is that I am a marshal artist, and have been for 
        nearly around ten years. Because I have been a 
        marshial artist of so long I can not remeber a time 
        in my life were I have never done Toshindo Karate.
        I was awared my first balckbelt on October 22nd, 2017
        and was recently awared my second degree blakc balckbelt
        on July 9th, 2022. To me karate is a discipline that 
        has taught me the importance of peresevirence and 
        resiliace that will last you your entire life.
        <br><br>

        Another activity that I have done for a long time was 
        band class. I have played the trumpet for around 6 
        years as of 2022 and is a skill I used often. I usually use theses
        skills to  play for my church (Scarsdale Community Baptist Church).
        <br><br>

        One other activity that I find importamt in community service 
        because it is important to give back to your communtiy since it has
        so much in helping me grow, learn, and develop as a person.<br><br>
